            <h1>Computer Science Honor Society Vice President</h1>
            <p>During my tenure as the Computer Science Honor Society Vice President, one of our successful fundraising initiatives was the Duck Raiser event. We sold ducks to raise funds for the society, supporting various activities and educational events for our members. It was a fun and engaging way to contribute to the growth of our society.</p>
